    <p><h2><strong>COVID-19:Do’s and Don’ts To Stay Safe During The Outbreak</strong></h2></p>
    <p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5)">Currently, in India, the rate has been increasing drastically and the Ministry of
     Health and Family Welfare has taken preventive measures to stop its spread. A simple hack 
     is to take precautionary measures to keep yourself safe from getting infected. Below points
     will give you an insight into some of the Do’s and Don’ts during the corona outbreak. </p>

  <div class="two-col">
  <div class="topcontainer tip">
    <p style="font-size:30px"><strong>Do's</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regular hand wash for 30 seconds will help you avoid germs or any kind of infection. 
      Use soap or hand sanitizer for better results and do this every time you travel or touch anything.

      </li><br>
      <li>Covering your mouth and nose while sneezing or when anyone next to coughs or sneezes can do you a lot better. 
      Coronavirus usually spreads through cough and covering your nose and mouth will save you from this epidemic.

      </li><br>
      
      <li>If you are suffering from a common cold, cough, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath and fatigue make it a point to consult a doctor 
      at the earliest. 
      Any of these symptoms could be a sign that you are suffering from the virus.

      </li><br>

      <li>Avoid being in crowded places. An infected person can spread the virus instantly and crowded places is a good way to accomplish this.
       Make sure you wear full sleeves shirts with anti-pollution masks when you travel. Staying indoors is a rather safe option.

    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="topcontainer danger">
    <p style="font-size:30px"><strong>Dont's</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not get close to anyone, especially touching or laughing closely. Also, use anti-pollution masks when out with friends or family.
       Avoid touching
       anyone and do not use the same utensils used by another. These simple non-touchy ways can do good until the outbreak comes to an end.

       </li><br>
      <li>Spitting can increase the spread of the virus. Avoid spiting at in public and home. Also, avoid getting close to a sick person 
      suffering from cold and cough.
      <img src="https://cdn-b.medlife.com/2020/03/No-spitting.jpg"  width="600" height="450">
      </li><br>

      <li>Travelling by cab, flight, bus, train and tramp can get you infected. Use anti-pollution masks and carry a hand sanitizer with you everywhere. 
      Consider travelling by your own vehicle and avoid public transport. In case you are feeling sick, it is advised that you avoid travelling and 
      consult a doctor at the earliest.

      </li><br>

      <li>If you are suffering from dry cough, back pain, nausea and shortness of breath it is recommended that you consult a doctor rather than opt 
      for self-medication that can leave you battling with a deadly illness. Say no to antibiotics as it 
      would later lead to antibiotic resistance.
